## Reactions
First off, it was a fantastic day. Although getting started in any new work
environment carries its own set of challenges, everyone at Viget is
beyond nice and helpful. It feels comfortable and easy to join in on
conversations at lunch and everyones willing to take a second and explain
something that may be new.

## The Dirty Details:
My main goal today was to start this blog and get it up and running with
GitHub Pages and Jekyll. This was not as easy of a task as I had been expecting
as GitHub's use of Jekyll is less than standard. Even this post, on first writing,
I am not entirely sure will post correctly. Overall, I was able to get something
up in a few hours.

The rest of my day was filled with meetings. The other interns and I met with
Sarah (the HQ Office Manager) and she gave us a rundown on the basic information
we need to know to get by in the office. Andy (the President) met with us to
explain, in general overview, how Viget works and makes money from its clients.

By far the best part of the day was meeting with Ben, Elyse, Caroline, and Vivian
(the other interns) and our advisors to brainstorm ideas about our summer-long
intern project. They are all bright and interesting people. AND, we were able to
come up with some fantastic ideas. Be excited for what is coming, we aim to excite
and impress.
