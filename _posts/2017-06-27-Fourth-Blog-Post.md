## Personal Project - HackerNews
HackerNews is done! I submitted the last piece of functionality along with tests
for code review today. Overall, it was a great project and lots of fun. Although
the web application does not look very pretty (sorry front end developers and
designers), building it was a fantastic way to work through and mess with a lot
of the things that Ruby and Ruby on Rails can do.

## Intern Project - GroundRules
The intern project has been going a lot better since my last post. We have done
our first retrospective, people have started trying to figure out their individual
roles within the overall team project, and things have started moving a bit quicker.
Although the application has not started to be built, and the overall product
definition is about where I thought we should have been a week ago, the project
seems much more thought out and we are in a good position to finish by the end
of our internship.

Baseline for the project: A responsive web application powered by a custom rails
                          Content Management System (CMS) that will provide access
                          to informative coffee-based information to interested
                          coffee drinkers. The product will launch under the
                          domain name, GroundRules.co, in August 2017.


## Personal Growth - My Place in the Project Stratosphere
I finally spoke with Josh Korr last Friday! We talked for over an hour and I
gained some new perspective on the role of a Developer on a project.

When the project started, I felt limited, unable to truly voice an opinion in
fear that I would be overstepping my bounds and stepping on someone else's toes.
This fear was unneeded. Rather than thinking of the product definition as anyone's
game, I was thinking of it as an important area of topic that I could weigh in on
but was ultimately the job and decision of the User Experience intern.

I was wrong -- product definition is everyone's ballpark. Instead of feeling limited
and powerless to speak up about my thoughts or opinions because it "isn't my place,"
I have now realized it is my place. I have a unique opinion as a person and as a
developer that no one else on the team holds, and I should use that for the benefit
of the team. This does not mean I should silence out others opinions, or make
rash/important decisions without consulting the rest of the intern project team,
but it does mean I have a voice and my voice can create a direction.

Thanks to Josh Korr and the other Vigets I have been able to talk to on this
subject, I feel more confident being myself and contributing to this project. In
addition to simply thinking about Product Definition, I have also been doing
some pretty serious brainstorming about how Developers can and should communicate
ideas to the rest of the "non-techies" on the team for the best result.

Designers, copyrighter, and UXers do not understand technology to the same level
as developers. And they can't, its not their role. And, although they may be
expected to know some amount of terminology and have some understanding of the
technology build process while working at a technology based company, it is wrong
assume they will have perfect information about this coming in.

Most technical concepts are new to them, they will not make immediate sense,
and it rests on the developer to be able to explain basic concepts to them. My
belief is that this is not hard if approached the right way.

## Next Up - Personal Project Round 2
This week I will begin building my second personal project. Something that should
be looked forward to with excitement and wonder. Excitement ... because its gonna
be fantastic. Wonder ... cause I am wondering what it will be.

Never fear! I will let you know soon.

Signing off, the ever cheerful, ever strange, and ever lovable,
Jason
