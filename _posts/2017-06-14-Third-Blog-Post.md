title: Day 7, Intern Project

The most mentionable item that I have been working on as of late is the group
intern project. So far, most of our work has been centered around User Experience
(UX) and determing the overall direction we want to go with the web application.

I had a different opinion about the overall goal of the project than the rest of 
the team and this has created some minor conflict. The disagreement is not about
the tactile direction but more of the intended impact of the application. I
would like users to leave with a better understanding of coffee while it my
colleagues would like to focus on improving our users' everyday coffee 
experience. Although I think my view could create a more used and appreciated 
application, I will have to bow to the group decision.

Caroline (the UX intern) has been working hard trying to generate surveys and
develop thoughts/ideas based on the feedback. The fact that our exact direction 
has not been decided yet concerns me -- I don't know how we will be able to 
agree on any concrete functionality for the application with approximately a day 
left without making a final decision about this in the next few hours.

Ben (the Front-End Development intern) and I had a minor 'not-disagreement' 
about the potential technical work on the web application. As the website 
will likely be more on the static side than vigorously dynamic it has been
difficult to determine both of our roles within the project. Especially 
without clear footing on the feature goals. Ben has felt the need to 
behemently defend his goal of working on the front-end display (something
I am more than happy to leave to him) in the context of my search for 
meaning within the project. 

The content mangagement system (CMS) I mentioned before may or may not be necessary 
within the scope of this project. If the website will not be updated after
the end of our internship, a flushed out CMS may not be necessary. I'm anxious
about my overall role in the project, but it seems like I'll just have to stick
in there a little longer and wait for more concrete answers to my questions.

Speaking with Emily Bloom (Viget's People Director) today was particularly helpful
in alleviating my concerns. She explained my thoughts and concerns about the 
current stage of the intern project are far from irregular and are a common
thing that comes up in early stages of a project at Viget. She recommended 
reading some blog posts from one of the Project Managers, Josh Korr, and 
speaking with him next week as he has done some serious thought and 
exploration on this subject.

Although I am currently feeling anxious about the direction of the project
I am confident that the issues can be resolved.
