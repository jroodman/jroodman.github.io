Seems I need to work on my consistency in writing these posts! 

## Personal Work
In the last couple days I have begun developing my HackerNews application -- a project to allow me to 
learn and practice Ruby on Rails. So far the project is going great! Ryan has been beyond helpful and 
has gone into great detail explaining to me the syntax differences between Ruby and more classically 
styled, compiled languages that I am more familiar with (like C++ and Java). 

Particular challenges with Ruby on Rails stem from the vast amount of work Ruby does behind the scenes.
Convention vs. Configuration has a nice ring to it, makes beautiful and easier to write code, but it is
hard to understand what is really happening with a program without diving into deeper details. This is 
where the learning curve is for me -- slowly gaining understanding into how Ruby works.

Ruby's use of symbols is also particularly intersting and a novel concept. Instead of using strings for 
everthing (or even enums), Ruby creates static strings that it calls symbols. In different ways you 
are able to use symbols to reference methods, data, create static strings, and more. Once understood,
it becomes a very powerful and compelling tool. 

I so far have completed the data models for HackerNews and am mid-way into creating the Controllers, Views, 
and Routes

## Intern Project
Our intern project is off to a roaring start! We have settled, after much debate, on creating a web app
centered around helping people learn about coffee and different brewing techniques. My role will be 
creating a content management system (CMS) for the web app.

This week we are already working hard to create a stronger definition of the project and our direction.
Just today we have begun competitive research, started a potential feature list, and have created a
survey question template to be used in asking people about their coffee use in local coffee shops 
in the area. 

The other interns on the project are great and surpass my expectations for their motivation, eagerness,
and interest in both their careers and this project. They are a pleasure to work with and are fantastic 
so far at both receiving and giving feedback. 

The future looks bright.
